Implementation of synchronous FIFO
–  Synchronous FIFO is a FIFO architecture in which data values are written and read sequentially from a memory array
 utilizing a clock signal.
– Verilog HDL was used to implement synchronous FIFO with four bit data width, sixteen depth, and two status signals
for full and empty.
